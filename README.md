# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
I chose the dataset “Financial Contributions to Presidential Campaigns by State” from the FEC website, for my Exploratory Data Analysis Project. There, I chose year 2016 and California State.
As part of my Data Analyst Nanodegree, I investigated the dataset using R and exploratory data analysis techniques, exploring both single variables and relationships between variables.
R is a powerful open source language, for data analysis.
